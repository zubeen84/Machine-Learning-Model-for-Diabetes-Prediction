# Machine-Learning-Model-for-Diabetes-Prediction
Diabetes dataset is used to predict whether someone will develop diabetes over the next five years. Prediction is based on various Machine Learning models and shows the efficiency and reliability of AI models in early disease detection. 

## Overview: 
Diabetes is a chronic disease with long‑lasting effects, and early detection is crucial to help patients receive timely medical intervention and manage the condition effectively. I built this project to explore how machine learning can be applied to predict diabetes risk, with the goal of supporting preventative healthcare and encouraging healthier lifestyle changes before the disease develops.

### The real‑world problem it addresses:
In many cases, diabetes can be prevented if the risk is identified well in advance. By accurately outlining risk factors, patients and clinicians can take proactive steps to reduce the likelihood of developing the disease. This project uses the Diabetes dataset to predict whether someone will develop diabetes over the next five years. It frames the challenge as a binary classification problem, applying supervised machine learning to provide reliable predictions that could inform early interventions.

### What makes this project unique and impactful:
The project demonstrates the efficiency and reliability of AI models in early disease detection. A very thorough data preprocessing pipeline was implemented to ensure accuracy: missing values and duplication were addressed, outliers were handled using the Interquartile Range (IQR), and skewed features were transformed using log functions. As the dataset was imbalanced, appropriate measures were taken to balance the target variable ‘Outcome’ for more precise predictions. The code was developed in Jupyter Notebook using Python, with robust support from libraries such as Scikit‑learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. This combination of careful preprocessing, model experimentation, and reproducible coding makes the project impactful as a demonstration of how AI can contribute to preventative healthcare.
